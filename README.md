# Google Workout Help
The Google Workout Help is an app for Wear OS and Android that lets users design circuits on their phone and run them on their smartwatch. It was written by Brodie Asker, Greg Brown, Kushagr Ahuja, Oliver Wales, Siana Zhekova, and Taylor Young for their University of Cambridge Part IB group project and was sponsored by Google.
